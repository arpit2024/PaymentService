   Q) How is the payment link created in the Payment Service?
Payment Service will communicate with the Order Service to get the order details(Amount ect)
and then create the payment link for that order

3).User -> Payment Link
-User clicks on the payment link and pays.
-payment is done and payment status is updated in the Payment Service
-user gets redirected to the callback URL

4).CallBack -> PaymentService -> OrderService
Callback URL makes a call to payment service to check the status of the payment
callback URL is called and payment status is updated in the Order Service

Also payment gateway calls payment service which is the webHook URL


what are the API's that we need to implememnt in the Payment Service
